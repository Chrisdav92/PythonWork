# PythonWork
A collection of projects, code and some nice snakes.
## Getting Started
Within this repository, programs will be added as I (Chris) continue to learn about parseltongue, er... I mean python. You, the reader, are required to sit back, open a project, then immediately say "Wow, shouldn't I be working?". 
### Prerequisites
Be alive
Have some water
###
Installing
You should have the latest version of the Python language installed. This should be Python 3.8.1 as of 2/12/2020
```
Also install various other packages, IDEs and any other software should you want to try out the other neat capabilities Python offers. 
```
I will be using packages like Pandas (for data wrangling), NumPy (for multi-dimensional data analysis), Matplotlib (for data visualization), and Seaborn (Matplotlib v2 for "pretty" data).
## Running the programs
Either copy and paste or try it on your own.
## Deployment
The programs I used (list will be updated if new software is used and why).

## Built With
